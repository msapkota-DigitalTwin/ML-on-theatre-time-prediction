### Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation for predicting theatre procedure times in a healthcare setting. It leverages data analytics and machine learning techniques to build predictive models aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and resource planning in hospitals. The repository includes self-built modules for data processing, encoding, and predictive modeling.

### Features

  #### Data Preprocessing and Encoding:
  
  Includes a custom-built module (data_processing_nd_encoding) for handling data preprocessing, feature engineering, and encoding tasks.

  #### Predictive Modeling:

  Utilizes a range of machine learning algorithms for theatre time prediction, with support for performance evaluation and model optimization.
  
  Contains reusable functions for predictive modeling (predictive_model_related_functions).


### Notebook for Model Training and Testing:

  A Jupyter Notebook (Training_and_testing_multiple_models_TO.ipynb) is provided to guide users through training, testing, and evaluating multiple models.
